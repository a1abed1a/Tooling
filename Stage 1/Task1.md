# The Idea
## (1)
**The problem**  
For our problem, there is a coffee shop that needs a website, so they contact us as web developers to create a website for their store, so that customers can see the products and menu without coming to their store, and they can order anything from their store.

They can order and book for an in-store event, stakeholders do not need users to have an account, users just fill out purchase or reservation forms, they want their online shopping cart function and on the homepage some pictures to promote the product and a map showing where their store is.

**Risks**  
And as for the risks, there are plenty of them, but here are some important ones to watch out for:
+ scope.\
Stakeholders can change the scope after we have made progress in web development, we can take down a large part of the web and stakeholders may change something, part of it or the entire website.
+ expectations.\
Web quality may be poor or not meet their expectations or some functionality may not be what they expect.
+ Teamwork.\
This is our first act as a team, so you don't know what's going to happen, are we going to be a good team and understand each other or be a bad team and be lazy and selfish.
+ scheduler.\
So like I said, this is our first job as a team, and we had some problems splitting and scheduling the work.

**Software Desing**
+ Requirements.
  + There should be 5 pages home, menu, cart, host an event, and about us.
  + There should be animations.
  + There should be a map showing where their store is.
  + There should be a menu that have multiple categories.
  + User can add any item in the cart.
  + User can remove any item in the cart.
  + There should be a subtotal price, shipping price, and the total price.
  + There should be forms to fill when finished.
+ Database design.\
We use local storage as a database, the system will save the cart in it and pull it out for further use.
+ Wireframe.\
About the wireframe this is not the final look of the website, 
of course will change the look of it and have a new ideas to add:\
**Home page**  
![home](/Images/home.png)  
On the homepage, it will view what the shop have like product, their location, and what they serve.  
**Menu page**  
![home](/Images/menu.png)  
On the menu page, it will view all the products that the shop have, and the can add what they need in a cart, and view the total price in the page.  
**Cart page**  
![home](/Images/cart.png)  
On the cart page, all the products added by the user in the cart are displayed, and they can increase their quantity, or remove them from the cart list, and the total amount of each product will be added to the final total and shipping fees, and to order the user must fill out the form.
**Host an event page**  
![home](/Images/host_an_event.png)  
On the hosting an event page, it will display some images of an event and then some text to tell what store of the event is, and to book the user must fill out the form.  
**About us page**  
![home](/Images/about_us.png)  
On the about us page, it will display a summary about the shop, lastly the heroes that develop it.  

+ Activity Diagram.\
 Here are the activity diagram that the user will take:

+ Coding and implementation technique.\
We use agile to manage our progress, so what is an agile?\
Agile is a project management and software development strategy that enables us to deliver value to our clients more quickly. The agile team saves a little work but is expensive. Continuously assessing requirements, plans, and outcomes so that teams have a natural way to adapt quickly.  
We choose agile to be able to adapt quickly to market developments or consumer input. Small, frequent changes to schedule and shipping allow us to get feedback on each change at minimal cost.  
In a common vision, we join in and then salute them as you know. Requirements for quality, usability and completeness are defined. Selecting Done then reveals how quickly we will be working. Although it can be intimidating at first, leaders are sure that this team feels more ownership and exceeds management expectations when they invest their faith in an agile team.
+ Testing technique.\
  The testing part is in Stage 3.
