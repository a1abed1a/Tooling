# The Idea
## (1)
**The problem**  
For our problem, there is a coffee shop that needs a website, so they contact us as web developers to create a website for their store, so that customers can see the products and menu without coming to their store, and they can order anything from their store.

They can order and book for an in-store event, stakeholders do not need users to have an account, users just fill out purchase or reservation forms, they want their online shopping cart function and on the homepage some pictures to promote the product and a map showing where their store is.

**Risks**  
And as for the risks, there are plenty of them, but here are some important ones to watch out for:
+ scope.\
Stakeholders can change the scope after we have made progress in web development, we can take down a large part of the web and stakeholders may change something, part of it or the entire website.
+ expectations.\
Web quality may be poor or not meet their expectations or some functionality may not be what they expect.
+ Teamwork.\
This is our first act as a team, so you don't know what's going to happen, are we going to be a good team and understand each other or be a bad team and be lazy and selfish.
+ scheduler.\
So like I said, this is our first job as a team, and we had some problems splitting and scheduling the work.

**Software Desing**
+ Requirements.
  + There should be 5 pages home, menu, cart, host an event, and about us.
  + There should be animations.
  + There should be a map showing where their store is.
  + There should be a menu that have multiple categories.
  + User can add any item in the cart.
  + User can remove any item in the cart.
  + There should be a subtotal price, shipping price, and the total price.
  + There should be forms to fill when finished.
+ Database design.\
We use local storage as a database, the system will save the cart in it and pull it out for further use.
+ Wireframe.\

+ Activity Diagram.\
+ Coding and implementation technique.\
+ Testing technique.\
  The testing part is in Stage 3.
