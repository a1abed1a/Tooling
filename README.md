# Tooling
## (1)
**Applications and other software are created, maintained, supported, and debugged using software development tools.**

There are several types of software development tools, each of which performs a specific role. There are Category for the tools :
+ IDE
+ Operating System
+ Version-control platform

And for the tools :
+ IDE
  + Visual Studio Code
  + PyCharm  
  \
  PyCharm is in the JetBrains IDE family, and all of these IDEs are extensible from plug-ins. At the moment, the JetBrains site has about 3000 extensions in PyCharm.  
  \
  On the other hand, VS Code is a simple editor that can be converted with extensions into a comprehensive IDE. VS Code provides almost all the extensions and developers can easily create their own. VS Code Marketplace is available for all of these extensions. So VS Code is more extensible than PyCharm.  
  \
  It's a bit hard to figure out how you can select the configuration options if you haven't used them before, and they include a number of functions that most people don't ask for much (advanced code reprocessing).  
  \
  It is very easy to configure VS code. All you have to do is enter Ctrl + Shift + P, there is a control panel to search for something and the results will appear.  
  \
  PyCharm is a great tool with many features that can facilitate development. Almost all the functions I use are accessible in VS Code and the only big feature that is not related to remote debugging is VS Code.  
  \
  This means that almost all the capabilities of PyCharm with much better performance and pricing (of course) than PyCharm are available in VS Code. In the industry, PyCharm is used, but my job in Python will be VS Code.

+ Operating System :
  + Linux
  + Windows  
  \
  Linux is an open source commercial operating system. In the event that Windows cannot access the source code, Linux has access and updates the user code as needed.  
  \
  In Linux, the user can view the kernel source code and modify the code as needed. It has its own benefits. Bugs are fixed at a fast rate in the operating system, but if developers are identified they can use any weaknesses in the operating system.  
  \
  Windows only has access to the source code for selected members. Every Windows user at some point has faced security and stability issues. Since Windows is a commonly used operating system, Windows is often used by hackers and spammers. Originally, Windows (custom editions) was supposed to be easy to use on a single PC that was free from the network and lacked integrated security measures. Microsoft regularly publishes its services for security fixes. They are published once a month, but important updates can be accessed at short or required intervals.  
  \
  The blue screen of death is commonly found by Windows operating system users. This is because the system failed to respond. In the end, the user has to remove their frustrations and manually restart the device. However, Linux relies on a multi-user design, which makes it more stable than just a single user, like Windows. Since Linux is built on a community that has frequent monitoring of developers around the world, any new problems may be resolved within a few hours and the required patch can be ready to provision.

+ Version-control platform :
  + GitHub
  + GitLab  
  \
  There are more than 40 million users on the Git-based platform, making it the largest source code hosting platform in the world. Tom Preston Werner, Chris Wanstrath and PJ Haight founded JetHub in 2008, and the company has grown rapidly since then.  
  \
  Projects on GitHub can be made public, and any piece of code that is published is freely available to everyone. Only three collaborators are allowed on the free plan for special projects.  
  \
  It is common for open source software to be shared via public GitHub repositories. GitHub can be used for issue tracking, documentation, and wikis in addition to its core code repository.  
  \
  A repository system that works similarly to GitHub, GitLab allows teams to collaborate on code. A ruby ​​and-go-based project management tool, GitLab has some similarities with GitHub's bug tracking and project management capabilities.  
  \
  A software company founded in 2011 by Dmitry Zaporozhets and Valery Sizov, GitLab now employs over 1,300 employees and according to Wikipedia, the company has 100,000 users (as of March 2017).

**In our project, we choose Visual Studio Code as our IDE, linux ubuntu terminal as our operating system, and GitHub as our version control platform.**

Here are some of the reasons for choosing the tools we chose to develop our app :

+ Visual Studio Code  
  \
  Visual Studio Code provides a fast and easy to use source code editor. VS Code helps you put syntax tags, parentheses, auto indentation, checkboxes, excerpts, and more, in a large number of languages. Easily pass code with intuitive, easy-to-customize keyboard shortcuts and community-based keyboard shortcut assignments.  
  \
  For serious coding, tools with a greater understanding of code than strings are often available. Visual Studio Code provides built-in support for IntelliSense code completion, semantic code understanding, code browsing and refactoring in the language.  
  \
  And difficult errors are corrected when coding becomes difficult. Debugging is the only feature developer who usually misses a lot while trying secondary code. Including an interactive debugger, Visual Studio Code allows you to browse source code, analyze variables, view call stacks, and execute commands on the console.  
  \
  VS Code also contains tools for building and scripting to perform common actions to speed up your daily routine. It supports Git, so you can work with source control, even see pending changes, without leaving the editor.

+ linux ubuntu terminal  
  \
  Git is a set of command line designed to run in a Unix command line environment. Command line terminals are integrated into Unix by modern operating systems such as Linux. This complements the work with Git with Linux. Instead, Microsoft Windows uses the non-Unix terminal environment, the Windows Command Prompt.  
  \
  Linux is an open source operating system. It is not only an operating system, but is currently used as a platform to power computers, servers, and embedded systems. It contains many distributions and variants, as it has a modular architecture and is open source. The main component of Linux is the kernel.  
  \
  Linux runs various services, including process planning, application planning, file system, and much more. Over other operating systems, such as Windows and macOS, Linux has many advantages.  
  \
  Linux can be downloaded and installed on your computer for free as open source. It's great for software creators, whether they are hobbyists, students, programmers, or professionals. All Linux systems are supported by you in the following languages: C, C++, CSS, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP. Although you may run into problems sometimes, you should ride well in most situations.

+ GitHub  
  \
  You probably know GitHub, which is a Git repository hosting service that also has a graphical web interface, if you are into software development. Today, I want to talk about it and talk about the main benefits of using GitHub.  
  \
  GitHub can be separated into Hub and Git. The service offers access restrictions and collaborative features, such as vital task management tools, for all the projects you handle. GitHub hosts your sources in a range of programming languages ​​and monitors the different modifications made to each iteration. So Git is a program that helps developers keep track of constant changes in code. The Hub is the community of like-minded people. It is all about the collective efforts of the community to evaluate, improve and extract new ideas from the provided code.  
  \
  Almost every open source project uses GitHub to manage their projects. GitHub is open source and has a wiki and an issue tracker that makes it easy for you to provide more detailed documentation and receive feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, simply implement a project, modify it and then submit a pull request via the GitHub web interface.  
  \
  Github gives insight into the peers and commits behind each source and visualizes each contributor and their commits across all cloned repositories. These analytics are especially powerful when working in teams.
